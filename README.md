# Person Re-identification with Deep Learning

Welcome to the Person Re-identification with Deep Learning project! This repository contains code for a deep learning model that can identify and match persons across different images and video frames. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Highlights

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The code efficiently loads and preprocesses image data, ensuring that it's ready for training your deep learning model.

- **Neural Network Model**: We've implemented a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for person re-identification, which includes convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, batch normalization, and fully connected layers.

- **Data Splitting**: The dataset is automatically split into training and testing sets, simplifying the process of training and evaluating the model.

- **Comprehensive Comments**: The code is well-documented with comments, making it easy to understand and modify for your specific use case.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Organize your image dataset into two subdirectories, one for each person you want to identify. Ensure that each person's directory contains the respective images.

2. **Run the Data Preparation Code**:
   - Execute the following code snippet to load and preprocess your image data. This function efficiently resizes images to a standard size and prepares them for training:

   ```python
   import cv2
   import random as rn
   import os
   import numpy as np
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

   def get_data(dir_path):
       # ... (Code for data loading and preprocessing)
       return np.array(x), np.array(y)

   # Load and preprocess your dataset
   dataset_path = main_dir
   data = []
   labels = []
   for person_name in os.listdir(dataset_path):
       person_dir = os.path.join(dataset_path, person_name)
       for image_file in os.listdir(person_dir):
           image_path = os.path.join(person_dir, image_file)
           image = read_and_preprocess_image(image_path)
           data.append(image)
           labels.append(person_name)
   # Convert labels to one-hot encoding
   label_mapping = {label: idx for idx, label in enumerate(np.unique(labels))}
   labels = [label_mapping[label] for label in labels]
   labels = to_categorical(labels, num_classes=len(label_mapping))
   # Split the dataset into training and testing sets
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

3. **Define Your Model**:
   - You can use the provided CNN architecture as a starting point. Customize it according to your specific person re-identification task by adding more layers or modifying existing ones.

4. **Training**:
   - Train your model on the preprocessed data using your chosen deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow or Keras). The data is ready for training, and you can easily access the training and testing sets.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - After training, evaluate the model's performance in person re-identification using the testing set. Metrics like accuracy and similarity scores can help assess its effectiveness.

## Requirements

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [Keras](https://keras.io/): Install the deep learning framework of your choice to run the model.
